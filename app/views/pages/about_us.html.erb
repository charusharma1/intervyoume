              <h3>How Intervyou.me was founded?</h3>
              <p>"As a college senior in 2013, I was thrilled when I made it to the final interview at a top trading firm for a six figure salary. Sadly, I failed the interview and didn't get the offer. I realized that I hadn't prepared enough, because I didn't know whom to practice with, and that my college friends were in the same boat. I really wanted to make this app for other job seekers to find experts and peers to prep with, and get their dream job."</p><p>
